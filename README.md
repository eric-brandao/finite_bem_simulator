# Simulate measurements above finite absorbers 

Simulate the measurement above finite samples on various scenarios such as:
- 1 source, 1 microphone
- 1 source, 2 microphones
- 1 source, 1 pu probe
- 1 source and a microphone array
- several sources (diffuse field)

The idea is to implement some simulators based on BEM. I'll start with a flat
sample flush mounted in a hard baffle.

In the future the aim is to be more general and allow simulations of non-locally
reactive samples.
